# Bigdata App Development

### Project Discription
In this project, we are aiming to provide meaningful information about restaurants in a given area in New York City. This is achieved by analysing and joining three different datasets: Yelp API, the new york city restaurant inspection results and New York noise complaints data. With an input of longitude and latitude, the application outputs the cleanliness and noise information about a square area around the input position. Technologies such as Spark SQL etc. are used to draw useful insight from the datasets.

input: Longitude and Latitude

output: Nearby restaurants with detail information
